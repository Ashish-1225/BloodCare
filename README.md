##About

BloodCare works as a platform for users to register as blood to either request/donate blood and blood banks to manage their stocks by managing 
the pending donations and request along with scheduling blood camps and managing them. The system will authenticate the user/bank using their 
username(mobile) and password to further perform other actions.

It includes managing and tracking blood donations, connecting donors with recipients, and providing real-time information on blood shortages and needs. 
The platform will include both a user-facing interface and an blood bank’s interface for managing the data.
